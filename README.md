ðŸŽ“ BITS Project Repository
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and solutions developed as part of the M.Tech in Data Science (BITS Pilani) program.
It serves as a structured collection of implementations, problem statements, and mathematical foundations across multiple subjects.

The focus is on writing clean, well-documented, and reproducible code for academic learning, experimentation, and future reference.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Strengthen foundations in Data Science and Applied Mathematics involving algorithm design and analysis.

Apply optimization and AI techniques to real-world problems.

Build a structured knowledge base for future research and projects.
