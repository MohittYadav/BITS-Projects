    "We can map the PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to the specific data structures, logic, and decision-making processes that define the agent’s (AI's) environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Performance Measure (P):**\n",
    "Goal: Maximize the chances of the AI winning the game while preventing the opponent (human player) from winning.\n",
    "Static Evaluation Function: This is the performance measure for the AI, scoring the current board state to evaluate how favorable it is for the AI.\n",
    "Positive Scores: AI is close to winning (e.g., forming a row of 4 pieces).\n",
    "Negative Scores: Opponent is close to winning, and AI needs to block.\n",
    "The AI will aim to maximize this score in each turn by evaluating future board states through the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.\n",
    "Winning Condition: The AI maximizes performance by getting four consecutive pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, while minimizing the opponent’s chances of doing the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Environment (E):**\n",
    "The environment consists of:\n",
    "*Game Board (board):*\n",
    "A 6-row by 7-column grid represented as a 2D NumPy array (board).\n",
    "The board is updated by dropping pieces (for either the human or AI) into one of the columns.\n",
    "Empty cells are represented by 0, player pieces by 1, and AI pieces by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Game Rules:*\n",
    "Players take turns placing their pieces into columns.\n",
    "A win occurs when four consecutive pieces are aligned vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Game States:*\n",
    "A terminal state occurs if either player wins or the board is full with no valid moves left (draw).\n",
    "Valid Locations: The AI must select a column with at least one open spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Actuators (A):**\n",
    "Actuators represent the actions that the agent can take to interact with the environment. In this case, the AI’s actuators are the actions that modify the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop Piece (place_piece):\n",
    "The AI places its piece into one of the valid columns.\n",
    "The function modifies the board by updating the state of the chosen row and column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Sensors (S):**\n",
    "The sensors define how the agent perceives the environment. The AI perceives the board through data structures and functions that provide information about the current game state:\n",
    "\n",
    "Board Representation (board): The AI senses the state of the game via the 2D NumPy array representing the board.\n",
    "Valid Locations (get_valid_locations): This function tells the AI which columns are available for placing a piece.\n",
    "Next Open Row (get_next_open_row): The AI uses this function to determine the row where a piece can be dropped in a valid column.\n",
    "Winning Move (winning_move): The AI checks whether it (or the human player) has already won by looking for four consecutive pieces in any direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structures:**\n",
    "Board (Environment): The central data structure is the 2D NumPy array representing the game board:\n",
    "This array is updated as moves are made, and its state is evaluated using various functions like score_position, winning_move, and get_valid_locations.\n",
    "Window (Evaluation): A \"window\" is a subarray of four consecutive cells that the AI evaluates during its decision-making process.These windows are used to score positions for potential winning or blocking opportunities in the game.\n",
    "Valid Locations: A list of available columns for the next move, which is recalculated after each turn:\n",
    "valid_locations = get_valid_locations(board)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fringe:**\n",
    "In the min-max search, the fringe is represented by the potential game states that are explored as the AI evaluates its moves:\n",
    "\n",
    " Min-max Depth: The depth-limited tree search explores game states up to a predefined depth (DEPTH = 3).\n",
    " \n",
    " Alpha-Beta Pruning: This optimizes the minmax algorithm by eliminating branches that do not need to be explored, reducing the fringe size and speeding up decision-making.\n"
